# Pomodoro Timer
Pomodoro Timer is a web application that allows you to set a timer based on the [Pomodoro® Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique).
## Background
The Pomodoro Technique® consists of having you select a task and working on it in intervals of 25 minutes with 5-minute breaks in between. After completing this routine 4 times, you can then take a longer 20-minute break. You can repeat this procedure as much as you need to. The goal of the technique is to boost productivity in a more efficient way.
## How It Works
1. Click **Start** once you are ready to begin working on your task for 25 minutes.
2. Once the alarm goes off, take your 5-minute break.
3. Repeat 4 times. After that, take your longer 20-minute break.
4. Keep doing this until you are done with your task!
## Features
- **Audio notification** alerting you when a timer session is complete.
- **Responsive web design** allowing flexible usage between desktop and mobile.
- **Dynamic timer** in desktop browser tab providing convenient view of timer while switching between tabs.
